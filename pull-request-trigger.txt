Highlight:
===========
Whenever we create another branch for development from a main/master branch and after all development work; we create a pull request from
"dev branch" to "main/master branch".

Then that time, we want to run a trigger to jenkins; so that we can check the new feature in real time and after all new feature verification in real time;
put jenkins status back to github and merge dev branch with main branch. 

After Merging to main/master branch; A full fledged pipeline should be trigger.
